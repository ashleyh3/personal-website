                <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: larger">QUESTIONS</span></span>

                <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">// PART 1 OF 3 //</span><br><br>

            There are four interaction styles.<br>
                <br><span style="color:red">STRUCTURE: Extroverted (which doesn't always mean peppy social butterfly), the kind who naturally takes charge, arguably dominating, in control, initiating, powerful, wants to take the reins. Direct, initiating, control.</span>
                <br><span style="color:darkorange">STARTER: Extroverted, a starter, spontaneous, boisterous, energetic about new things, initiates. Informative, initiating, movement.</span>
                <br><span style="color:gold">SEE-IT-THROUGH: Introverted, a quiet type who sees it through (really annoyed if something's unfinished), toned down, generally responsible. Direct, responding, movement.</span>
                <br><span style="color:limegreen">BEHIND-THE-SCENES: Introverted, a behind the scenes type, kind of floaty, can be flaky, more spontaneous, responsive. Informative, responding, control.</span>

            <br><br>Which of those four sounds MOST like you?
                <br><input type="radio" class="interaction-style-1" name="structure" value="structure" required><span style="color:red">  structure</span><br>
                <input type="radio" class="interaction-style-1" name="starter" value="starter" required><span style="color:darkorange">  starter</span><br>

                <input type="radio" class="interaction-style-1" name="background" value="background" required><span style="color:limegreen">  behind the scenes</span><br><br>

            Which of those four sounds SECOND MOST like you?
                <br><input type="radio" class="interaction-style-2" name="structure" value="structure" required><span style="color:red">  structure</span><br>
                <input type="radio" class="interaction-style-2" name="starter" value="starter" required><span style="color:darkorange">  starter</span><br>

                <input type="radio" class="interaction-style-2" name="background" value="background" required><span style="color:limegreen">  behind the scenes</span><br><br>


            There are also four temperaments.<br>
                <br><span style="color:darkturquoise">IDEALIST: Head in the clouds, people-focused. Philosophical, endless social possibilities, future focused, searching for the ideal. Often an artist, dreamer, poet, humanities, caring (but these can be stereotypes).</span>
                <br><span style="color:dodgerblue">INTELLECTUAL: Head in the clouds, follows logic or rationale. Future-thinkers, systems & probabilities, live in a world of "what if." Often engineers, on Reddit, scientific (but these can be stereotypes).</span>
                <br><span style="color:blueviolet">ARTISAN: Grounded, in the moment, observant, spontaneous, fun, adaptable, free, creative, improviser. Test the rules, test traditions. Live in the moment, mechanical aptitude.</span>
                <br><span style="color:hotpink">GUARDIAN: Grounded, responsible, disciplined, in some ways traditional, rigid, reliable, planner. Safety, past-focused, "should do." Storytelling, long-term memory experience.</span>

            <br><br>Which of those four sounds MOST like you?
                <br><input type="radio" class="temperament-1" name="idealist" value="idealist" required><span style="color:darkturquoise">  idealist</span><br>

                <br><span style="font-weight: bold">// PART 3 OF 3 // -- Please don't go backwards from this point! It could bias the rest of your answers.</span><br>

                <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-size: smaller">(Don't get too hung up on the dichotomies.)</span></span><br><br>

                E/I: The dichotomy (1 of 4) that you probably know is <span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight: bold">EXTROVERSION</span></span> or <span style="color:darkorange"><span style="font-weight: bold">INTROVERSION</span></span> -- this doesn't just mean where you get your energy!

                <br><span style="color:red"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Extroversion means:</span> your dominant brain mode focuses outward, you primarily live out in the world, outside of yourself, not so stuck in your head, you naturally initiate.
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Extroversion does NOT mean:</span> always a shallow peppy social butterfly -- outgoing live-breathe-work managers/CEOs throwing themselves into their work are extroverts too!</span>
                <br><span style="color:darkorange"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introversion means:</span> your dominant brain mode focuses inward, you're usually stuck in your head, mentally inside yourself, you usually respond rather than initiate.
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introversion does NOT mean:</span> antisocial, smart.</span>

                N/S: Dichotomy 2 of 4 is <span style="color:gold"><span style="font-weight: bold">INTUITION</span></span> or <span style="color:limegreen"><span style="font-weight: bold">SENSING</span></span>.
                <br><span style="color:gold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Intuition means:</span> you care more about theory, usually head in the clouds, mentally distant
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Intuition does NOT mean:</span> deep, creative, interesting, only ones interested in academia</span>
                <br><span style="color:limegreen"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sensing means:</span> you care more applying theory, usually aware of physical environment, observant
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sensing does NOT mean:</span> without depth or creativity -- often sensors are better at life because they're not overthinking everything
                <br>(Example: maybe an intuitive will fail math because they have to understand the meaning, whereas a sensor is like, "...but the teacher told us the steps. It's obvious.")</span>

                <br><span style="color:darkturquoise"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Thinking means:</span> valuing logic/rationale/truth over relationships/morals/forgiveness, natural inclination towards facts and justice

                J/P: Dichotomy 4 of 4 is the least important, <span style="color:blueviolet"><span style="font-weight: bold">JUDGING</span></span> or <span style="color:hotpink"><span style="font-weight: bold">PERCEIVING</span></span> -- honestly don't worry about this on a surface level, at all.

            <br>Think of perceiving as input and judging as output.
                <br><span style="color:blueviolet"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Judging means:</span> your dominant way of interacting with the world is output, initiating, making decisions
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Judging does NOT mean:</span> judgmental! (the stereotype is actually being a planner and/or rigid -- not true)</span>
                <br><span style="color:hotpink"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Perceiving means:</span> your dominant way of interacting with the world is input, receiving, gathering information

                  When you get your result, don't let the four-letters throw you off. "Feeler? Then I'm worse at thinking?" = NO! Neil deGrasse Tyson is a "feeling type."

                  <br><br>Myers Briggs exists to help you understand your cognitive processes, <span style="font-weight: bold">how your brain operates</span> relative to others'.
                  When you get your 4-letter code, go look up the <span style="font-weight: bold">cognitive functions</span> that make you you.
                   I'll link some sites with your result that will hopefully help you understand yourself and grow!
                   <span style="font-style: italic">(because knowing "I'm I not E" or especially thinking "I'm 45% extroverted 55% introverted" is wrong and useless! Avoid any sites that do this!)

                              "Introvert/extrovert quizzes are so funny because they're always like:

            You and your friends are going out to dinner. Everyone has agreed on one restaurant, but you're not feeling it. What do you do?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Say something, why would I want to stay silent and be unhappy? I should at least speak my mind! (or: You go but it's obvious that you're mad, everyone can tell.)<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Say nothing, go with the flow... I would feel uncomfortable disrupting the harmony.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            How do you feel about art?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Art is important to me! Expression is a deep part of me, reflecting my soul.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Art is nice and everything but I have shit to do... can we get back to my schedule?<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            How naturally do you feel you understand emotions?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Other human beings are kind of foreign to me. Like... feelings wat.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Pretty naturally.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            Let's say you're in an environmental science class. What are your goals?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Learning. I'm focused on understanding why climate change is happening. I want to understand, it'll drive me nuts if I don't get it. I'd even sacrifice a better grade for understanding.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>Getting a good grade. I'm focused on finishing these homework assignments, there's a test coming up... I'd sacrifice learning something for getting it done by the deadline, for sure.<br>

            Your friend tells you that their parent just died. How do you try to comfort them?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>I imagine myself as them, in their shoes, try to infer how they're feeling from their words & body language, guess how their family is probably coping... I naturally exercise compassion.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>I think about times I've felt similarly, maybe when my grandparent died, and relate those emotions to them. I naturally exercise empathy.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            I'm making a tough decision, like whether to break up with someone. What's a more realistic thought process?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>I love them, but it feels like it's time, I have other things to focus on. I'm no longer as emotionally invested, I know I'll be deeply sad without them, but logically, I've decided to do it. I'm following my logic.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>I love them, but I don't feel the same passion I used to... I think it all stems from the way the fact that they don't care about social justice like I do, we don't share the same values, and it breaks my heart but I feel I should end it. I'm following my values.<br>

            You're talking to an old friend, someone very different from you. What are you more likely to proudly mention? What's more noteworthy?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>"Yes my social life is thriving. But guess what? I finished a little computer science project! I've been meaning to do it forever, I've gotten carried away with other things, but I was so logical today! It was great!"<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>"Yes my career is thriving. But guess what? I handled a relationship problem so well today! I'd been having conflict with a coworker for a while but today I asked to talk and we communicated and we both feel better! I was so socially aware today! It was great!"<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            Where is your head?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>In the future, or the past... really anywhere but the present. I'm a space cadet. I'm not saying I'm stupid but my mind is like soup, busy... connecting things.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>In the present. Like, if I'm talking to you, I'm there... or maybe looking at a dog walking by or thinking about how hungry I am idk but I wouldn't say I'm a space cadet. I'm in my body.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>It's really hard for me to decide this... somewhere in the middle?<br><br>

            Would you say you're down to earth, or head in the clouds? A martian or an earthling?
            <br><input type="radio" class="" name="" required>A martin, a space cadet, my head is in the clouds. I think I'm pretty abstract, not good with literal.<br>
            <input type="radio" class="" name="" required>An earthling, grounded, I am definitely on earth. Aware of my surroundings, present in my life.<br>
